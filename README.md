# OLED display VU meter — AVR/arduino project

This project is to create digital version of a nice gadget that adds a little magic 
to any audio equipment: a [VU meter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VU_meter).

Project uses AVR ATMega88/168/328, and ATMega48 if possible, so should be compatibile with
Arduino Uno boards. Small (and cheap) monochrome OLED modules with SSD1306 driver are 
employed as displays.

Here's a video showing test of rendering needle against background:
